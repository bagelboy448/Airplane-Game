The engine tests were meant to model a very realistic turbojet, for the purpose of 
later integrating it into the actual game. Tests 1 through 3 showed potential, but 
they always seemed to have at least one critical flaw. Test 4 was a last ditch 
effort to simplify the engine to a workable/useable state, but that failed so the
tests were abandoned. 

Ideally, each engine would model its compressor pressure ratio not with a single 
ratio, but by actually calculating the pressure difference across each compressor
using lift coefficients and attack angles. Somewhere in there is the potential to
model a realistic compressor stall/surge, as well as ideal mixtures of fuel and 
air.

This failed because I ultimately don't know enough for certain to model such a 
system. Modeling an entire jet engine is, understandably, a complex task. Also,
I was never satisfied with anything less than a perfect model, so I kept pushing
to make it work. Finally, the overhead required to simulate a realistic engine(s)
is far too much to include in an actual game, at least from the way it was 
looking.
